1. should we try reducing the data set? could this ever help? if there are countries that don't fit what we are trying to model perhaps, which is probably closer to tourism?
2. introducing a variable for english speaking % of country could be a really good one and accessible statistic
3. should we be combining hte population and internet percentage into one variable? what are the impliciations? feels good to get a population of internet accessible people, but then losing the overall populatiom as a term could be problematic?

Tests:

1. Distance from UK vs without
  * France one of top guesses...
  * distribution has long tail
  * not sure if the distance frmo uk overlooks issues with australian/nz tourism
  * Fewer surprises of top guesses without
  * distributino looks weirder though without, multimodal... without distance. and this means that there are a lot of guesses vs fewer
  * verdict? not sure tbh I thihnk if we were going to keep it we would need to actually consider australian and nz listeners, maybe even us listeners but that would be trickier
  * so because we are unsure let's remove
